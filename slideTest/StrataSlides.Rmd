  vs. Trade Volume Relationship
header-includes: null

##Quick Intro
- Machine Learning Engineer   

- Masters in applied mathematics and statistics from Johns Hopkins University  

- Bachelors in pure mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania  

- Spent years working in Healthcare, Finance, and Telecommunications industries in  roles spanning data analyst, software engineer, and data scientist

- Talk is based on my graduate thesis

##Problem Statement 
How can we accurately predict trade volume?  
    
  - many trading algorithms depend on volume  
  - accurate volume predictions over a given interval allows traders to be more effective  
  - volume prediction increases trading strategy capacity, controls trading risk

How can we understand the relationships between trade volume and price volatility?
    
  - new information on the market causes agents such as hedgers and speculators to trade until prices reach a revised equilibrium which then changes price and trading volume
  - provides information on the efficiency of futures markets which regulators can then use to decide upon market restrictions
  
## About the Data
- Hundreds of millions of rows of futures trading in the form of order books 
- Comes from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
- Collected from May 2, 2016 to November 18, 2016 
- Raw data from the CME included extended hours trading 
- Fields included instrument name, maturity, date, time stamp, price, and quantity  
- Futures were comprised of 22 financial instruments spanning six markets  
    - foreign exchange, metal, energy, index, bond, and agriculture 
- Trades were recorded roughly every half second
- Product defined as instrument/maturity pair
    - 149 products in total

#Methods

##Processing Data
How can we efficiently process the overwhelming amount of data such that it is amenable to analysis?   

We use Apache Spark to process the data  

- What is Spark?  
    - Spark is a fault-tolerant and general-purpose cluster computing system providing APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R
- One node cluster set up
    - Linux Server
    - 32 cores
- Used Python API, i.e. Pyspark
- Used SparkSQL for parsing and reformating, treating raw data as table
- Data became manageable to visualize with pure python and analyze in R

#Regression
##Spline Prediction
What is a spline?

- Spline basis functions are piecewise polynomials used in fitting curves which are linear in terms of the basis function.
- Cubic splines in particular have been found to have nice properties with good ability to fit nonlinear curves. 
- Cubic splines are made to be smooth at the knots, endpoints of intervals on the x-axis
    - Force first and second derivatives of the function to agree at knots

##Use Penalized Spline in GAM
- Called a smoothing spline
- Penalty is integrated second derivative
- Cost function   

      $\sum_{i=1}^N [y_i-f(x_i)]^2 + \lambda \int f''(t)^2 dt$   

- GAM = Generalized Additive Model  
    - Instead of:  
      $E[Y|X_1, X_2,...,X_p]=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+...+\beta_pX_p$  
    - We have:  
      $g(E[Y|X_1, X_2,...,X_p])=\beta_0+f(X_1)+f(X_2)+...+f(X_p)$, where g is the link function. 

##Models
<div class="centered">
```{r out.width = "700px", echo=F}
#library(rmarkdown)
#latex_dependency('multirow', options = NULL)
knitr::include_graphics("predictors.jpg")
```
</div>

- One Model Paradigm: One model for all markets   
- Multiple Model Paradigm: One model for each market  
- Primes are before instrument is added
    - We want to know if knowing the instrument makes model better
    - "s" denotes spline basis function on predictor variable

#Regression Results
##Spline Curves
<div class="centered">
```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=F}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\anito\\Documents\\Grad_School\\JHU\\700\\thesis writeup\\splineDoM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\anito\\Documents\\Grad_School\\JHU\\700\\thesis writeup\\splineTTM.png")
```
</div>
- Day of month spline curves reinforce patterns seen in the exploratory analysis visualizations of essentially constant daily trade volume 
- Also see anticipated periodicity, but shows a dip around day 8 of 30 for all markets with the exception of FX.
- The time to maturity spline curve for bond serves as reinforcement of the differences given that the curve begins
to rise sharply around 150  days

<div class="notes">
- TTM doesn't stay low as anticipated.
- The upward trend due to the effect of ZQ, as 150 days is where it begins to deviate from the other instruments. 
- Proper modeling should separate ZQ from other bonds.
</div>

##Comparing All Models at Market Level
<div class="centered">
```{r echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("resultsTab4.jpg")
```
</div>
- Consider the best model 
- Agriculture, energy,and index
    - Relative errors of 0.182, 0.113, and 0.164 respectively  
- Metal, bond, and FX 
    - Relative errors of 0.379, 0.254, and 0.301 respectively

##Comparing Models at Instrument Level
<div class="columns-2">
```{r out.width = "450px", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("resultsTab2.jpg")
```

- Relative error is under .20 for most instruments. 
- Exceptions are both metals (GC and SI) as on the market level, both FX instruments (6E and GE) as on the market level, and three
bonds: 30 Day Fed Fund (ZQ), 30 Yr U.S. Treasury Bond (ZB), and 10Y Treasury
Note (ZN).  
- Relative errors are 0.360, 0.405, 0.2676, 0.459, 0.257, 0.266, and 0.227 respectively.

#Relationship Between Trade Volume and Price Volatility

##Trade Volume Data Set
```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("trade_volume.jpg")
```

##Price Volatility Data Set
```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("price_volatility.jpg")
```
volatility measured with standard deviation

##Consistency of Correlations
- We want to know if correlation doesn't change with time

- Product must have at least 30 data points

- Look at hourly data and calculate correlation between trade volume and price volatility. 

- Regress correlations on day

- Test for $\beta_1=0$

- Correct for multiple testing error using B-H Procedure

##Look at Active Trading period

Dashes denote 60th-90th volume percentiles

##Anything Truly Interesting?
- ZQ and 5 year treasury note (ZF) showing idealized pattern of dense population above zero. 
- Moreover, none of the products manifest a sharp increase, which typically delineates low and high volumes. 
- We can safely exclude the effects of nascent and near maturity periods from all but Rbob gasoline (RB) since the selected area of
this product is still very close to maturity. 
- Non-constant correlation significance is legitimate for ZQ, mini Dow Jones index (YM), heating oil (HO), and ZF 
- These products price volatilities will not be well predicted by trade volume over time because their correlation does not remain constant.

##Checking Daily and Hourly Correlations
</div>
<div class="notes">
0 correlation useless for predicting price volatility from trade volume.
</div>
<div class="centered">
```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=F}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\anito\\Documents\\Grad_School\\JHU\\700\\thesis writeup\\CL2017-01-20hourly.png")
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\anito\\Documents\\Grad_School\\JHU\\700\\thesis writeup\\CL2017-01-20daily.png")
```
</div>

This is what we expect based on past research.

- Positive correlation
- Consistency accross time intervals
- Most products manifest both


## Deviating Products

## Deviating Products Cont'd

</div>
<div class="notes">
- for most products the daily correlations are stronger and less noisy than the hourly correlations. 
- In some cases where there is clustering, such as Kc Hrw wheat (KE), 30 Yr U.S. Treasury Bond (ZB), and soybean meal (ZM),
- Observations should be partitioned into low and high volumes before taking correlations into account for price prediction. 
- For agriculture instruments seasonality and temperature most likely play a part in the trade volume clustering observed.
</div>

##What we Conclude 
- Apache Spark is an efficient way to process massive datasets. 
- Using a penalized regression spline is an effective way of predicting trade volume, granted products are similar and we have large set of data to fit models.
- The covariates most indicative of trade volume are time to maturity and instrument
name
- Penalized regression splines are a useful tool for tasks such as building
trading algorithms, improving traders' effectiveness, and controlling trading risk. 

##What we Conclude Cont'd
- Predicting price volatility from trade volume is viable in the majority of cases, as long as forecasting is made
over a trade's active period since correlations observed are constant over time.
- Theory behind speculator and hedger behavior since positive correlation between trade volume and price volatility, validating 
- Positive correlation between trade volume and price volatility is not maintained across all time increments. 
    - Positive correlation is mainly observed in measurements made daily, but for the same product, the correlation is not necessarily observed hourly.
- In cases of product seasonality, clusters exist and negative correlations may be seen for trades maturing in six or more
months in the future. 

<div class="notes">
- These new insights advance regulatory decisions on futures markets
- Hoped conclusions stated will inspire others to delve further into the study of futures markets in general.
